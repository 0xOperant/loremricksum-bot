Awww, it's you guys! Rikitikitavi, bitch! What the fuck is going on?! Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.

And that's why I always say 'Shumshumschilpiddydah!' Meeseeks were not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! Awww, it's you guys! I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit! Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming, anyways.

Allahu blehhhh Akbar! I don't think we can perform our new song, The Recipe For Concentrated Dark Matter for a crowd this tiny! I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collin's proverbial paradise. I wish that shotgun was my penis.

Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty! Aww, gee, you got me there, Rick. That just sounds like slavery with extra steps. Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants from over here, I just assumed that was um.. Turd Man, Wiggly Turd Man.
